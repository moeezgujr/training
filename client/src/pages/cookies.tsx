              This Cookie Policy explains how Meeting Matters LMS ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website and learning platform. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

            <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work efficiently and to provide reporting information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Meeting Matters LMS) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our website and learning platform to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Third parties serve cookies through our website for analytics, personalization, and advertising purposes.
            </p>
